The scientific question that drives my research is to map genetic variants to diseases and characterize underlying molecular mechnisms. To answer this question, I develop statistical and machine learning methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and single-cell genomic data. Specific areas are described as follows.

### Single-cell eQTL and allele-specific expression



### Mendelian randomization

Mendelian randomization is an approach to use genetic variants as instrumental variables to conduct causal inference.

### Multi-trait genetic association analysis
