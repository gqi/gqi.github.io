I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington ([UW faculty page](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/guanghao-qi)). My research is centered around developing statistical and machine learning methods for **multi-omics approaches to genetic studies**. These methods typically use data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and functional genomic data such as single-cell RNA-seq. Specific areas include:

* *Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and GWAS data.*

* *Multi-trait genetic association analysis.* 

* *Mendelian randomization.*

See [here](research.md) for more details.

### News!
* **January 2025:** Qi receives a 5-year K01 award from NIH to develop statistical methods for integration of single-cell eQTL and GWAS data.
