I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. My research is centered around **multi-omic approaches to statistical genetics**. I develop statistical and machine learning methods to understand the effect of genetic variation on complex traits. These methods typically use data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and functional genomic data such as single-cell RNA-seq. Specific areas include:

* *Integration of single-cell eQTL and GWAS data.*

* *Multi-trait genetic association analysis.* 

* *Mendelian randomization.*

See [here](research.md) for more details. Check out my list of publications [here](publications.md).

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University in 2020 (advisor: [Nilanjan Chatterjee](https://nilanjanchatterjee.org/)), and completed postdoctoral training also at Johns Hopkins (advisor: [Alexis Battle](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/)).
