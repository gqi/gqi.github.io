I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods for large-scale genetic and genomic studies. Areas of interest include statistical genetics, Mendelian randomization, single-cell genomics and bioinformatics.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University in 2020 (advisor: [Nilanjan Chatterjee](https://nilanjanchatterjee.org/)), and completed postdoctoral training also at Johns Hopkins (advisor: [Alexis Battle](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/)).
