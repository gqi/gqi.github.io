I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington ([UW faculty page](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/guanghao-qi)). My research is centered around developing statistical and machine learning methods for multi-omics approaches to genetic studies. These methods typically use data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and functional genomic data such as single-cell RNA-seq. Specific areas include:

* **Integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and GWAS data:** Using single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) data to investigate biological mechanisms underlying variant-trait associations.

* **Multi-trait genetic association analysis:** Integrating information a wide range of traits to yield novel insights into genetic architecture. 

* **Mendelian randomization:** Using genetic variants as instrumental variables to study causal effects between risk factors and diseases.

See [here](research.md) for more details.

## News!
* **January 2025:** Qi receives a 5-year K01 award from NIH to develop statistical methods for integration of single-cell eQTL and GWAS data. 
* **March 2025:** The TWiST method for single-cell TWAS is now on medrxiv ([link](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.17.25324128v1)).
